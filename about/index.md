I'm Christophe Bédard, an undergraduate computer engineering student at Polytechnique Montréal. I also have a B. Eng. in mechanical engineering.

Since 2014, I've been involved in [Élikos](http://elikos.polymtl.ca/), an engineering student design team working on autonomous drones. We competed in mission 7 of the [International Aerial Robotics Competition](http://www.aerialroboticscompetition.org/) at Georgia Tech in Atlanta, Georgia. The goal was to autonomously interact with roombas on the ground in order to guide them to a goal line. That had to be done while avoiding obstacles and without any external positioning sensor. In 2015, with a custom platform, my team ranked first in North America for demonstrating autonomous tracking and following of a ground robot. In 2016, we won the award for Most Innovative Vehicle and ranked second. I've now been leading the team since 2017.

My other involvements include the _Association Étudiante de Polytechnique_, as well as the _Fonds d'Appui aux Initiatives Étudiantes_, which awards grants to innovative student projects.
