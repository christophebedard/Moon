I'm Christophe Bédard, an undergraduate Computer Engineering student at Polytechnique Montréal who is passionate about robotics and new technologies. I also have a B.Eng. in Mechanical Engineering.

From 2014 to 2019, I was involved in [Élikos](https://elikos.polymtl.ca/), an engineering student design team working on autonomous drones. We competed in mission 7 of the [International Aerial Robotics Competition](http://www.aerialroboticscompetition.org/) at Georgia Tech in Atlanta, USA. The goal was to autonomously interact with roombas on the ground in order to guide them to a goal line. That had to be done while avoiding obstacles and without any external position sensor. In 2015, with a custom platform, my team ranked first in North America for demonstrating autonomous tracking and following of a ground robot. In 2016, we won the award for Most Innovative Vehicle and ranked second. I led the team from 2017 to 2019.

My other involvements include the _Association Étudiante de Polytechnique_, the _Association des sociétés techniques de Polytechnique_, as well as the _Fonds d'Appui aux Initiatives Étudiantes_, which awards grants to innovative student projects.

### Working experience

* 2019 - **Platform/RTOS Intern, Apex.AI** (Palo Alto, United States)  
  I worked on integrating tracing into [Apex.OS](https://www.apex.ai/apex-os), as well as adding instrumentation in order to extract run-time information about all layers of the software stack.

* 2019 - **Intern/Praktikant, Bosch** (Renningen, Germany)  
  I worked on open source [tracing tools](https://gitlab.com/micro-ROS/ros_tracing/ros2_tracing) and instrumentation for [ROS 2](https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/), including [trace data analysis tools](https://gitlab.com/micro-ROS/ros_tracing/tracetools_analysis).

* 2018 - **Open Source Developer, Ericsson** (Montréal, Canada)  
  I worked on [Trace Compass](http://tracecompass.org/), an open source trace viewer and analysis framework ([contributions](https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/q/owner:cbourquebedard)).

* 2017 - **Intern, [MIST Lab](http://mistlab.ca/), Polytechnique Montréal** (Montréal, Canada)  
  I helped demonstrate swarming behaviour on drones and ground vehicles.
