It's been a while since [ROSCon 2018](https://roscon.ros.org/2018/), but I thought I'd (_finally_) write some thoughts down. Hopefully without too much rambling.

## Context

I've been around ROS for a little while now. At first it was from a distance. I only knew the basic concepts, but I still had to work around it. However, a couple years ago I slowly got more and more interested and actually started using it. I thought it was a very powerful concept, and its community and open-sourceness really made me want to contribute.

## Why

Why not?

## Objectives

I had never been to a tech conference (by myself or for myself), and I didn't really know what to expect -- I didn't know _exactly_ what I wanted from it.

However, my one objective was to talk to other attendees and learn _something_ from them. Sure, I'm still a student and don't have as much experience as them, but I still have something to offer.

One thing I was sure of is that I'd learn a lot from the presentations. I was really looking forward to the presentations on ROS 2, since I hadn't really tried or read a lot about it. ROS 1 is still way more mature, but as companies are slowly starting to move to ROS 2, especially for new products or applications, this is the best moment to get started!

## The conference

The presentations were very interesting! For the topics I was familiar with, I was eager to see what other people were doing. For the others, I was simply curious. Here's a few highlights:

* ROS 2-specific presentations, including a [how-to on getting involved in ROS 2 development](https://vimeo.com/292699328) and a [demo of the main features](https://vimeo.com/292693129).

* ["Lessons learned building a self-driving car on ROS"](https://vimeo.com/292693011) and ["ROS 2 on Autonomous Driving Vehicles,"](https://vimeo.com/292695688) which were interesting applications of ROS to self-driving. They also mentioned real problems, like determinism and real time.

* ["Integrating ROS and ROS2 on mixed-critical robotic systems based on embedded heterogeneous platforms"](https://vimeo.com/293304372) and ["Towards ROS 2 microcontroller meta cross-compilation,"](https://vimeo.com/293305909) which showed that plans are for ROS 2 to be used for much more than what ROS 1 was generally used for, which is of course very exciting.

* The [`performance_test` package](https://vimeo.com/293257342) for testing middleware peformance for ROS 2, from Apex.AI. Since I'm interested in the tooling side of robotics software development (e.g. tracing & analysis), this was quite a nice surprise!

* and other cool presentations, such as ["Deterministic reversible debugging of ROS nodes with Mozilla rr,"](https://vimeo.com/293623186) ["Hermetic Robot Deployment Using Multi-Stage Dockers,"](https://vimeo.com/293626218) and ["Deterministic, asynchronous message driven task execution with ROS."](https://vimeo.com/293540767)

Between presentations and during the lunches, I talked with other attendees, including both people from academia and the industry!

The biggest event of the conference was obviously the evening reception on the first day ~~because of the beer~~. I motivated myself to go talk to people, and that led me to have some nice conversations and meet some very interesting people. I learned about a couple projects that I then started to follow, like the [Open Vision Computer](https://github.com/osrf/ovc).

## What I learned

Looking back, it was a great experience and I learned a lot, and not only from a technical point of view.

I learned that you always have something to offer, whether it's a different point of view, a different background, or simply the cool stuff you've done. No matter how little experience you think you (might) have. For example, people I talked to had never heard of the [aerials robotics competition I spent 3-4 years competing in](http://aerialroboticscompetition.org/), which involved real challenges that I was able to discuss! Even if it wasn't in a strictly-professional setting, those challenges are still similar to the ones people in the industry can face. In this case, I mentioned that I worked on autonomous obstacle avoidance in a sterile environment, without external position sensors.

## Conclusion

Overall, it was a very nice experience. It made me look forward to the future.

It made me want to get involved in ROS development. I have made (very) small contributions to ROS 1 since then, and I look forward to doing more, especially for ROS 2! Now I'm really hoping I can attend ROSCon 2019 in Macau!

All in all, you can't learn anything if you never try, so jump in!
